# Python-wave-display-and-draw
Draw a wave, put it into .wav file to hear the sound. Or look how the sound looks.

Since I learned how sound is stored I wanted to know how certain sound waves sound.
So I created those python scripts to try this. This is how it came out.
Made in 4 hours, because I'm begginer.
